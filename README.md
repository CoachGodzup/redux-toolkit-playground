# Redux Toolkit playground 🏰

Just a simple example on how to use Redux toolkit.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## What's that? 🔎
It's a super simple counter made in React and Redux Toolkit. Just for the sake of it, I added another fruit random chooser.

But, as some Disney Character said in Aladdin 🧞
>It's not what's outside, but what's inside that counts

## What's in the box 🧃

You can find in the `store` folder a simple store with two reducer (`counter` and `fruit`), and in the `reducer` folder all it's needed to the store to work properly, reducers, actions and types.

I decided to use two reducers to show how to merge and how to interact with them. Two actions (`incrementCounter` and `decrementCounter`) accept one parameter.

I used fruit emoji 🍏 because... who don't like emojis? 😁😁😁


## How to grind its gears ⚙️⚙️

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
