# Redux Toolkit playground 🏰

Just a simple example on how to use Redux toolkit.

## What's that? 🔎

It's a super simple counter made in [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/), based on [Fabio Biondi](https://formazione.fabiobiondi.io/) tutorials founded on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW-2TyUyyII&t=1189s). 

Just for the sake of it, I added a fruit random picker.
I used fruit emoji 🍏 because... who don't like emojis? 😁😁😁

But, as someone said in [Aladdin](https://youtu.be/fR97iXFp_gE?t=45) 🧞

> Like so many things, it's not what's outside, but what's inside that counts.

## What's in the box 🧃

You can find in the `store` folder a simple store with two reducer (`counter` and `fruit`), and in the `reducer` folder all it's needed to the store to work properly, reducers, actions and types.

I decided to use two reducers to show how to merge and how to interact with them. Two actions (`incrementCounter` and `decrementCounter`) accept one parameter.

## How to grind its gears ⚙️⚙️

It's super simple! 🙌

in the project directory, install all the dependencies via `yarn` as usual

> `yarn install`


Then you can run:

> `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser and... enjoy it! 🍹

The page will reload if you make edits 🔁.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console ⚠️.
